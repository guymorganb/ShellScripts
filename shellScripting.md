# Shell Scripting Cheat Sheet (Language **Bash**)
**Bash** a popular command-line interpreter for the Unix operating system. It's often used for writing shell scripts.

Shell scripting is a powerful tool with many uses. Here are some key uses and capabilities:

## Key Uses of Shell Scripting
- **Automating repetitive tasks**: Shell scripts can automate routine tasks such as data backup, system updates, or cleaning directories.
- **Running scheduled jobs**: With the help of cron jobs, shell scripts can be scheduled to run at specific times.
- **Monitoring system health**: Shell scripts can be used to monitor system metrics like CPU usage, disk space, and network traffic.
- **Managing users and processes**: Shell scripts can create or manage users, kill processes, and more.
- **Data processing**: Shell scripts can process log files or text data, extract information, generate reports, and more.

## Capabilities of Shell Scripting
- **File and text manipulation**: Shell scripting excels at manipulating files and text data. It can create, delete, move, copy files, and perform complex text processing operations.
- **Command execution**: Shell scripts can execute any command that can be run from the command line.
- **Flow control**: Shell scripts support conditional statements, loops, and branches, allowing for complex logic.
- **Process control**: Shell scripts can start, stop, and manage system processes.
- **User interaction**: Shell scripts can interact with the user, taking input and providing output.

# Shell Scripting Cheat Sheet

## Key Uses of Shell Scripting
- Automating repetitive tasks
- Running scheduled jobs
- Monitoring system health
- Managing users and processes
- Data processing

## Capabilities of Shell Scripting
- File and text manipulation
- Command execution
- Flow control
- Process control
- User interaction

## Basic Shell Commands
- `echo "text"`: Print text to the console.
- `read varname`: Read input from the user and store it in varname.
- `pwd`: Print the current working directory.
- `cd directory`: Change the current directory.
- `ls`: List directory contents.
- `mkdir directory`: Create a new directory.
- `rmdir directory`: Remove a directory.
- `rm file`: Remove a file.
- `cp source destination`: Copy files or directories.
- `mv source destination`: Move/rename files or directories.
- `cat file`: Display file content.
- `grep "pattern" file`: Search for a pattern in a file.
- `find directory -name "pattern"`: Find files or directories matching the pattern.

## Variables
- `VAR=value`: Define a variable.
- `echo $VAR`: Access a variable.

## Command-Line Arguments
- `$0, $1, $2, ...`: Script name and arguments.
- `$#`: Number of arguments.
- `$@`: All arguments.

## Control Structures
- `if [ condition ]; then ... fi`: If statement.
- `for var in list; do ... done`: For loop.
- `while [ condition ]; do ... done`: While loop.
- `case $var in pattern) ... ;; esac`: Case statement.

## Comparisons
- `=`: String equality.
- `-eq`: Numeric equality.
- `-ne`: Numeric inequality.
- `-gt, -lt, -ge, -le`: Greater than, less than, greater or equal, less or equal.

## Arithmetic
- `$(( expression ))`: Arithmetic expansion.

## Functions
```bash
function_name() {
  # code
}
```

## File Test Operators
- `-f file`: True if file exists and is a regular file.
- `-d directory`: True if directory exists.
- `-r file`: True if file is readable.
- `-w file`: True if file is writable.
- `-x file`: True if file is executable.

## Redirections
- `command > file`: Redirect standard output to a file.
- `command < file`: Take input from a file.
- `command >> file`: Append standard output to a file.
- `command 2> file`: Redirect standard error to a file.
- `command1 | command2`: Pipe the output of command1 to command2.

## Quoting
- `""`: Double quotes (allows variable and command substitution).
- `''`: Single quotes (literal string).
- `\\`: Escape character.

## Special Variables
- `$?`: Exit status of the last command.
- `$$`: Process ID of the script.
- `$!`: Process ID of the last background command.

## Permissions
- `chmod, chown, chgrp`: Change file mode, owner, and group.

## Networking
- `ping host`: Check if host is reachable.
- `curl url`: Fetch content from a URL.
- `wget url`: Download files from the web.

## Script Shebang
- `#!/bin/bash`: Use bash to interpret the script.

## Debugging
- `set -x`: Print commands and their arguments as they are executed.
- `set -e`: Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.

This cheat sheet covers many of the core aspects of shell scripting. For more detailed information or specific use cases, consulting the man pages (`man bash`, `man command`) or online resources would be beneficial.
